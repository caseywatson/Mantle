Mantle
======

Mantle is a framework for building massively scalable .NET-based applications that can be hosted either on-premises or on a variety of public cloud providers including Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS.

Cloud fragmentation has become a serious concern for many organizations due to the fact that moving from one public cloud provider to another can often times be time consuming and expensive. Mantle attempts to address these concerns by providing a transparent application hosting platform that effectively separates domain-specific application logic from the underlying enterprise infrastructure.

Mantle is distributed under an [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.
